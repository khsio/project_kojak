# Shopper Behavior Analysis
This project is about exploring shopper behavior and build a shopping cart recommender using Instacart data.

## Introduction  
In this project, I want to explore customer shopping behavior by analyzing their pervious purchases and build a shopping cart recommender that could give them a tailored shopping experience to drive engagement.  

I want to perform a [Shopper Behavior Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_behaviour) by analyzing shoppers purchase history and see if I could find patterns such as what kind of items customers like to purchase in different time of day/week, how often do people reorder the same product they purchased before and etc. And build a [recommender system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) using customer's reordered purchases and [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).

## Project Design
1. Perform Data Cleaning, merging different tables together and do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
2. Analyze customer behavior, generate insights and build data visualizations for storytelling.  
3. Define a metric for model evaluation.  
4. Lastly, create a shopping cart recommender system to recommend items to customers based on their purchase history.  

## Getting Started
* `notebooks` - My code for exploratory data analysis, data visualizations, recommender system and metirc calucation are in this folder.   
* `presentation` - This is the deck that I used to present in [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/). For references, please refer to the reference page in my deck.
